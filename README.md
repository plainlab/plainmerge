# PlainMerge - An offline PDF mail merger

for each of them. You got the PDF form and all your staff information in an Excel file.

That's when PlainMerge helps.

After inputting an Excel file and a PDF file, you can drag and drop the Excel headers

You got 100 different PDFs for each employee now.
