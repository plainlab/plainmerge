## What is this?

Imagine you want to fill a PDF form for 100 employees with a specific name and address
for each of them. You got the PDF form and all your staff information in an Excel file.

That's when PlainMerge helps.

After inputting an Excel file and a PDF file, you can drag and drop the Excel headers
into arbitrary positions or match them with native PDF form fields, and then PlainMerge
will generate multiple PDFs for you based on rows in the Excel file.

You got 100 different PDFs for each employee now.
